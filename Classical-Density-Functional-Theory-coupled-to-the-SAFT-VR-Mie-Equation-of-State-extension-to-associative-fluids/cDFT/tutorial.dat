---------------------------------------COMPILING AND RUNNING---------------------------------------
To run the CDFT_SAFTVRMIE code, compile the "main.f95" and "association.f95" files with the FORTRAN 
compiler of your preference, and run the executable.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------INPUT DATA----------------------------------------------------
The "input.dat" file has the following structure:
Line 1: Temperature (K);
Line 2: Number of components, which should be set equal to 1;
Line 3: Bulk molecular density (A-³), sigma_fluid (A), epsilon_fluid/kB (K), lambda_a, lambda_r, m, 
Phi, epsilon_hb/kB (K), rc/sigma, rd/sigma, sites;
Line 4: ns(1), ns(2),...,ns(sites).
In Line 3, "Phi" is calculated in accordance with Equation 22;
In Line 4, "sites" is the number of types of association sites (2 for water, following the 4C 
scheme), and "ns(i)" is the number os sites of type "i". The parameters "sigma_fluid", 
"epsilon_fluid/kB", "lambda_a", "lambda_r", "m", "epsilon_hb/kB", "rc/sigma" and "rd/sigma" 
are equal to the ones of the bulk SAFT-VR Mie EoS, as mentioned in the main text.

-------------------------------------OUTPUT DATA---------------------------------------------------
During the execution of code, two types of information are printed to the screen: the residual 
chemical potential, in reduced form, i.e. divided by (kB.T), and the total difference between the 
density profiles of two consecutive iterations (error). Once the normalized error (error/number 
of slabs) is less or equal to the specified tolerance, the calculation is finished, and the 
resulting density profile is printed to the file "profile.dat". For high bulk densities, it might
be necessary to decrease the value of parameter "alpha", which is the mixing parameter of the 
Picard iteration scheme, and the tolerance.
